    <p class="mt-4 mb-2"><strong>Greetings!</strong> Thank you for the opportunity to participate in the selection process. Here you can find some information about the things I did and things I did not.</p>

    <p class="font-weight-bold mt-4 mb-2">Employee Data</p>
    <p class="mb-4">When I started working on the projects, I examined the employee entries data and found out that some of the entries had missing names, and some of the entries had deleted-on property set to a value. My understanding was that entries with no names should belong to a separate category and that entries with the deleted-on property should not be taken into count, since they have been deleted.</p>

    <p class="font-weight-bold mt-4 mb-2">Scalability</p>
    <p class="mb-4">I tried to make this project as much future friendly as possible, with setting modules for every scope of code and pulling types and constants into their own files.</p>

    <p class="font-weight-bold mt-4 mb-2">Ngrx</p>
    <p class="mb-4">I believe that Ngrx makes applications scalable and clean, so I implemented it here, together with effects.</p>

    <p class="font-weight-bold mt-4 mb-2">Components</p>
    <p class="mb-4">This time I decided to use generic Table and Chart components, which can always backfire and result in trade-of where they are reusable, but less understandable. I am passionate about both approaches, and would in many cases choose to build tightly coupled components. I believe it is important to put a lot of work into contemplating, modeling and refactoring generic components into their best version, which these two might not be at the moment.</p>

    <p class="font-weight-bold mt-4 mb-2">Testing</p>
    <p class="mb-4">I strive to implement integration and unit tests into every app I make, but in this case I did not have time to do so. Some things were more important (Unfortunate excuse for many apps in the world).</p>

    <p class="font-weight-bold mt-4 mb-2">Employee Information Table</p>
    <p class="mb-5">Action buttons with no purpose at the moment are introduced so the table would resemble the example one, from the project requirements image.</p>
